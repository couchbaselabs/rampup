  "description": "Start one client, which starts to sequentially mutate all items once; against couchbase, that's just blind sets.  Concurrently, sequentially query the 'last' (high-fan-out) index 10,000 times, using a greater-than-or-equal query, limit 10 rows per query and stop this step (the concurrent mutations) when all 10,000 sequential view accesses are done."
